title: About me
---

I am a gradaute student from the Neurobiology department in Northwestern University, currently applying for a PhD position. I completed my master's thesis with [Professor Lee Miller][lee-lab].  
That being said, I am still actively pushing forward to learn and strengthen my ideas about my specific research direction. During my undergraduate and graduate studies, I have been working with different neuroscience reserach projects that include **human, non-human primate (NHP) and rodent** as participants/subjects. I have gained experience using recording systems that are both **invasive** with high accuracy, and **non-invasive** with low accuracy, to collect electrophysiological signals from **various brain regions**, including primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and hippocampus. These experiences gave me a solid sense of what are the main questions in neuroscience and electrophysiology, how the research projects are currently conducted in the field, and what are the possible ways to push these questions further.  
My current research interest is mainly on using invasive, single-cell level recording devices to look into how NHPs and humans encode envionment information, and how the brain uses these information to respond to the environment. I am hoping to learn more if I could get a chance to get into a PhD program, and continue to dig deeper into the unknowns of the brain.
