title: About me
---

I am a gradaute student from the Neurobiology department in Northwestern University, currently applying for a PhD position. I completed my master's thesis with [Professor Lee Miller][lee-lab].
That being said, I am still actively pushing forward to learn and strengthen my ideas about my specific research direction. During my undergraduate and graduate studies, I have been working with different neuroscience reserach projects that include human, non-human primate (NHP), rodent as participants/subjects. I have gained experience using recording systems that are both invasive with high accuracy, and non-invasive with low accuracy, to collect electrophysiological signals from various brain regions. These all gave me a good sense of how the research is currently conducted in the field, and what are the possible ways to push these questions further.  
My current research interest is mainly on using invasive, single-cell level recording devices to look into how NHPs and humans encode envionment information, and how the brain uses these information to respond to the environment. I am hoping to learn more if I could get a chance to get into a PhD program, and start to dig deeper into the unknowns of the brain.
